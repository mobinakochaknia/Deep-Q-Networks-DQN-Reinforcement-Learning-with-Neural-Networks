# 🚀 Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Reinforcement Learning with Neural Networks

## 🏆 Overview

This notebook focuses on **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates deep learning with Q-learning. The goal is to train an agent to make optimal decisions in game-like environments using neural networks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement **DQN** to approximate the Q-function using deep neural networks.
- Train an agent to interact with an environment and learn optimal policies.
- Use **experience replay** to improve stability and convergence.

## 🛠 Dependencies & Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib
```

## 🔑 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Introduction to DQN

- **Why Deep Q-Networks?** ➝ Overcomes the limitations of tabular Q-learning.
- **Experience Replay** ➝ Improves sample efficiency and learning stability.
- **Target Network** ➝ Reduces instability by maintaining a separate Q-value estimator.

### 2️⃣ Implementation of DQN

- **Neural Network Architecture** ➝ Maps states to Q-values.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy** ➝ Balances exploration vs. exploitation.
- **Loss Function & Optimization** ➝ Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) with Adam optimizer.

### 3️⃣ Performance Evaluation

- **Reward Tracking** ➝ Monitors cumulative rewards over episodes.
- **Training Stability** ➝ Evaluates Q-value fluctuations.
- **Policy Testing** ➝ Runs trained agents to assess decision-making quality.

## 📂 Metadata Files

- **Stored metadata files** include trained models, logs, and performance metrics.
- These files allow further fine-tuning and reproducibility of experiments.

## 🚀 Execution Steps

1. Install dependencies and initialize the environment.
2. Train the agent using the DQN framework.
3. Evaluate the performance and analyze learning curves.
4. Use saved models to run additional experiments.

## ⚠️ Notes

- **DQN requires significant training time** due to neural network updates.
- **Experience replay is essential** for improving learning efficiency.
- **Proper hyperparameter tuning** greatly affects final performance.
