# Deep-Q-Networks-DQN-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Neural-Networks
This notebook focuses on Deep Q-Networks (DQN), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates deep learning with Q-learning. The goal is to train an agent to make optimal decisions in game-like environments using neural networks.
